# MNIST Dataset Recognition with Neural Networks on Google Colab

## Overview

This project on Google Colab is all about using neural networks to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. MNIST provides images of numbers (0 to 9), and the goal is to train a computer model that can accurately identify these numbers.

## Project Structure

1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing:**
   - Explored and prepared the MNIST dataset for the computer model on Google Colab.
   - Adjusted the data to ensure it's ready for the neural network to understand.

2. **Neural Network Model:**
   - Built a neural network model on Google Colab using tools like TensorFlow.
   - Trained the model to recognize patterns in the MNIST images.

3. **Training and Evaluation:**
   - Taught the neural network using a set of images and evaluate its learning performance.
   - Tested the model on new images to assess its ability to recognize digits.


## Getting Started

Follow these steps on Google Colab:

1. **Open the Colab Notebook:**
   - Upload the provided notebook (`mnist_recognition.ipynb`) to your Google Colab workspace.

2. **Run the Notebook:**
   - Execute each cell in the notebook to go through the steps of exploring, preprocessing, training, and evaluating the neural network.

3. **Experiment and Customize:**
   - Modify the notebook as needed to experiment with different settings or ideas.

## Dependencies

Ensure that your Colab environment has the required tools:

!pip install tensorflow scikit-learn matplotlib

## Dataset

The MNIST dataset is accessible directly in Colab. No need to download it separately.

## Future Improvements

Explore ways to enhance the project:

- Experiment with different neural network architectures.
- Adjust parameters for better model performance.
- Investigate additional techniques to improve recognition.
